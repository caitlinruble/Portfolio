## Project Notebook 

The code included is a summarized Jupyter Notebook containing all steps of the Data Science Method. For version history of each component draft, click [here](https://github.com/caitlinruble/Springboard/tree/main/Assignments/Classifying%20Disease%20-%20Capstone).

Summary Notebook includes:
  - Loading Data (ensure the 'training.csv' file is in the same folder in order to run this code)
  - Data Cleaning & Wrangling
  - Exploratory Data Analysis 
      - Distributions of diagnoses by symptom, distributions of symptoms by diagnosis, heatmap of feature relationships with target categories
      - Calculation of Predictive Power Score for each symptom feature
  - Preprocessing and Training Data Development
      - Label Encoding of cateogorical target variable and TrainTestSplit
  - Machine Learning using SciKitLearn:
      - Entropy-Based Decision Tree, Gini-Impurity-Based Decision Tree, AdaBoost, Gradient Boost, XGBoost, and SVC with RBF Kernel
  - Discussion of model selection. For final model metrics click [here](https://github.com/caitlinruble/Portfolio/blob/2461a7ea010151c572ab1c75a2c206ac52f9fdaf/Patient%20Diagnosis%20with%20Machine%20Learning/Report/Model%20Metrics.md)
